## A h2 header

To write code, you indent it by 4 spaces or a tab. Remarkable will guess what language you are writing

    def main():
        print"Hello World"
    
 
 
 You can also use delimited blocks like so
 
~~~
 public class Markdown {
       public static void main(String [] args){
               System.out.printn("Makdown is simple!";
       }
}
~~~
 
 
 You can specify which programming language you are using with delimited blocks if you wish 
 
~~~c 
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf("Remarkbale markdown editor");
    return 0;
}
~~~
 
 
### A3 h3 header ###

Here is a link to the Remarkable website
[Remakable](http://remarkableapp.github,io)

Remarkable will also auto-detect links, eg:google.com

Here is how to specify an image
![Remarkable](http://remarkableapp.github.io/images/remarkable.png)

A horizontal rule is as follows:

---

~~Strikethrough text~~
==Highlight text==
Sometext~Subscrip~
Sometext^Superscript^


---

You can specify an inline MathJax equation like so $x^2+y^2=z^2$ 

Or a block level equation with two dollar signs on both sides of the equation:
$$\sum_{i=0}^ni^2=\frac{(n^2+n)(zn+1)}{6}$$

Here's a "line block":

|Line one
|Line two
|Line three

### Notes about Remarkable

With Remarkable you export your file to HTML or PDF through the `File` menu. You can also copy the converted Markdown to HTML to the clipboard through the `Edit` menu (Copy to HTML；Copy Selection to HTML).

You can swap the position of the editor and live preview pane, switch you a horizontal layout and even hide the live preview pane completely.(See `View` manu).

You can switch to na "Night Mode" by clicking`View->Night Mode`.Note that only some Gtk themes support this, it depends on which theme you are currently using.

You can click on links in the live preview pane to verify them.To return to the markdown document just edit the file(e.g.make a space and delet it).
